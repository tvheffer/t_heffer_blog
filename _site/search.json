If you leave it as numeric, R will assume it is a continuous variable. In other words, that category one is 1 unit smaller than category two, which of course is nonsense for nominal data. This is a critical step and will save you issues with plotting and analyses down the road!\nNominal variables (Factors): categories with no particular order (sex, gender, hair color, etc.) \n\ndata$sex &lt;- factor(data$sex, labels = c(\"males\", \"females\"))\n\nOrdinal variables: categories with order relations (grades, social status, etc.) \n\ndata$education &lt;- ordered(data$education)\n\n\nLikert items (e.g. ranging from 1 “completely disagree” to 5 “completely agree”) are sometimes a tricky data type. Technically they are ordinal and should be treated as such when they are a response variable. However, we often treat them as continuous when they are predictors. \n\nMetric scale level (aka numerical): distance relation between the values (income, IQ,SAT, age): - Ratio scale: natural 0 point (income, body height, etc.) - Interval scale: no natural 0 point (temperature Celsius, year, etc.)\n\ndata$anxiety &lt;- as.numeric(data$anxiety)"
